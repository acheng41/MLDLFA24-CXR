## Domain Generalization for Chest X-Ray Imaging
Group 7: Rena Bi, Andrea Cheng, Emily Guan, Aprina Wang


### Abstract
Background In real-world healthcare settings, variations in imaging practices create domain shifts that can reduce the performance of models when applied to new clinical sites. Challenges in medical data privacy make collecting comprehensive datasets from all domains infeasible, and labeling datasets can be extremely labor intensive. Our goal is to design a domain generalizable classification model to identify 3 pathological states in chest X-rays: pneumonia,non-pneumonia disease, normal. Related Work Overall, papers focus on two
aspects for domain generalization of medical imaging data: architecture and training scheme.
